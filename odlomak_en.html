CHAPTER I — Numbers 427, 428 and 429

In the generator factory on the outskirts of the city, the day always began with the sound of the siren — a short, piercing tone at 6:00 a.m. that didn’t wake you up, but threw you out of bed. The walls of the locker room were gray, damp with condensation, as if even the air had no strength to breathe. Fluorescent lights hummed quietly, yet relentlessly, mocking the tired faces staring back at themselves in the cracked mirrors above the sinks.

Workers arrived without words. Nobody talked in the mornings anymore — there was no energy for it. Three among them, Number 427 (Marko), Number 428 (Jelena), and Number 429 (Dragan), knew each other by their looks and by the mechanics of movement — rehearsed steps, like the precise hands of the same old mechanism.

---

“Today’s quota — five more pieces per shift,” Jelena read from the paper pinned next to the line. She wasn’t even surprised. It was the fifth day in a row the number had gone up. Nobody explained why. Nobody asked....

---

CHAPTER XXVI — Pressure

By morning, “state representatives” had already arrived at the factory. They wore no uniforms, but everyone knew who they were. An inspector with a badge, a man with a briefcase, and a woman who did not introduce herself but spoke words that carried weight: “Labor Law, Article 183 — an unauthorized halt of production without prior notice is considered sabotage. This may have consequences for each participant individually.”

Ilija remained silent. Marko said: “And we will sue you for coercion, violation of the right to health protection, and illegal surveillance. We have witnesses. And recordings.”

The woman did not move. She simply said: “This will not end the way you think.”

Jelena stepped toward her, slowly, without fear: “Maybe. But we will no longer live on our knees. If we must, we will all walk away. But you will be left without a factory.”
